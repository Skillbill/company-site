<b>3 Experience in IT</b>

<b>Technical degree</b>

As a recent graduate, I swiftly transitioned into the role of a software developer, quickly gaining experience in diverse projects spanning both front-end and back-end development. My expertise primarily lies in back-end technologies, with proficiency in building high-performance web services with Rust and Axum. Additionally, I have utilized Python FastAPI, and JavaScript/TypeScript with Express for other back-end projects. On the front-end, I've demonstrated versatility, employing Elm, JavaScript/TypeScript with React/Solid/Vue, and Tailwind for various projects.

I thrive on challenging myself; the greater the difficulty of the task, the more passionately I immerse myself in it.

I embrace self-reflection as a key aspect of personal growth, consistently seeking to identify and overcome my areas of improvement. By acknowledging and addressing my flaws, I strive to continuously enhance my skills and abilities.

I'm a team-player, valuing open communication and adaptability. I actively contribute to achieving shared goals and collaborate effectively with diverse perspectives.

I thrive when collaborating with like-minded individuals who offer both support and constructive challenges to achieve better results. I value working with those who share a common vision and possess the ability to enhance our collective efforts.
