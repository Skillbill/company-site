        <h2>Skillbill in the World</h2>
        <p>
            Being a small team hasn’t stopped us from dreaming big. <br>
            Skillbill works with international customers, interacting and integrating with teams that are located all
            around the world. <br>
            Skillbill has an important history on it, which can prove its ability. Since its early days Skillbill has
            efficiently jumped at the opportunity given by Internet to serve remote customers across the world as if
            Skillbill were the next door company. And we don’t mean plain vanilla offshore outsourcing for routine
            tasks,
            but again challenging projects and awesome products aimed to be the next big thing. And who knows, soon
            enough
            Skillbill will be physically located at the next door of many companies all around the world. <br>
        </p>

        <h2>Remote work</h2>

        <p>
            In Skillbill we use <b>remote first</b> model: we can work from any place but if we want we can
            also use one of the two current officies.
            Currently Skillbill's worker are all located on the Italian territory.
