            <p>
                Skillbill's <b>recruitment</b> is tough. In most cases new colleagues are junior and they enter in a long and intense <b>training</b> period. We do a constant <b>evaluation</b> of the people's skills trying to enhance them project by project.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have maximum <b>transparency</b> in internal and external communications helping to create cohesion.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a prepared and productive human capital we are able to establish long partnerships with our clients based on <b>trustiness</b>.
