Last 30th May we did our first remote Hackaton !

The development team worked together for a whole day on a brand new idea.

The topic of the hackaton was "tv-live reaction": a SmartTv application  to vote during a live event.

We started from scratch by brainstorming, we worked divided in some teams and at the end of the day we made a demo of the final result.
We had fun a lot and the finaleffect was great !

It was nice to work together where everyone used their experiences in a free and effective way.

This is the [project repository](https://github.com/Skillbill/hackaton-20210528-tv-live-reaction) and a demo is available [here](https://live-reaction.skillbill.net/) (use the r, g keys , b, y)
