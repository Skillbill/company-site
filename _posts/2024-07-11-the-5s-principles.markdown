# The 5S of Software Engineering

## 整理 (Seiri) - Sort
Eliminate unnecessary items from the workspace. In software engineering, this could mean removing redundant code, obsolete documentation, or outdated tools.

## 整頓 (Seiton) - Set in Order
Arrange necessary items in a logical and efficient manner. For software teams, this involves organizing code repositories, documentation, and development tools for easy access and use.

## 清掃 (Seiso) - Shine
Keep the workspace clean and tidy. For software engineering, this translates to maintaining clean code, regularly refactoring, and ensuring that development environments are uncluttered and well-maintained.

## 清潔 (Seiketsu) - Standardize
Establish standards for maintaining organization and cleanliness. In software projects, this involves creating coding standards, documentation guidelines, and consistent development practices.

## 躾 (Shitsuke) - Sustain
Develop the discipline to maintain these standards over time. This is perhaps the most challenging step, requiring ongoing commitment and regular audits to ensure adherence to established practices.
