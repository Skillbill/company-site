How can I be a better software engineer?

We've often tried to answer this question at different stages of our lives. Here at Skillbill, through discussions about what this profession must be and represent, we developed a theory.

Initially, the prevalent opinion among young engineers is that being a good software engineer is about using cutting-edge technologies and implementing them into new projects to enhance the productivity of a customer's software.

However, as an engineer's seniority increases, the trend often goes opposite. With many years of experience in software engineering and consultancy, you will likely encounter many ongoing projects with several issues that, if not handled correctly, can reduce the productivity of the software engineers working on them to near zero.

This is the Legacy Code problem, well explained in IT literature. We can mention "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers or "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler.

These resources are useful when you need to handle legacy code, but here at Skillbill, we aim to prevent code from becoming "legacy" to maintain high productivity in projects.

How do we do that? By following the 5S principles in projects where we provide consultancy.

Reading "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin, the author emphasizes the necessity of keeping code clean to avoid it becoming legacy and unproductive.

Let's break down those principles.

## The 5S Principles
Originally from the Japanese industry Toyota, this method can also be applied to software engineering.

### 整理 (Seiri) - Sort
Eliminate unnecessary items from the workspace. This means analyzing and removing redundancy, outdated documentation, and obsolete tools.

### 整頓 (Seiton) - Set in Order
What is necessary needs to be kept in order. For software teams, this involves organizing code repositories, documentation, and development tools for easy access and use not only for the present team but also for future team members.

### 清掃 (Seiso) - Shine
Keep the workspace clean and tidy. In software engineering, this translates to maintaining clean code, regularly refactoring, and ensuring that development environments are uncluttered and well-maintained.

### 清潔 (Seiketsu) - Standardize
Establish standards for maintaining organization and cleanliness. In software projects, this involves creating coding standards, documentation guidelines, and consistent development practices.

### 躾 (Shitsuke) - Sustain
Develop the discipline to maintain these standards over time. This is perhaps the most challenging step, requiring ongoing commitment and regular audits to ensure adherence to established practices.

At Skillbill, we believe that these rules should be kept in mind regardless of the programming language you are using. However, some developers here find that following these rules makes the software engineering process smoother and more enjoyable.
