To develop REST APIs in Java in a micro-services architecture, is it better, from the point of view of resource consumption, to use SpringBoot or Quarkus?
Spring Framework is a stable and resilient tool, but it uses exaggerated memory and computational resources. Will new technologies like Quarkus be able to maintain the same quality while using fewer resources?
This [article](https://medium.com/swlh/springboot-vs-quarkus-a-real-life-experiment-be70c021634e) explains some pros and cons of these frameworks by analyzing a real case.
