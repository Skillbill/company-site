Some weeks ago the Marketing guy asked me our logo in a vectorial format. We had some versions of it every of them different from each other (and yes a version with colors swapped for a mistake !).

As a developer, like everyone here in Skillbill, I decided to produce the image writing a program. I said that the reason was to have a new version of the logo versioned and more easy to manage... the true reason is that I love coding and graphical libraries/tools to do it (never heard about [OpenScad](http://openscad.org/) ?!).

I created the logo in JS and with the [Paper.js library](http://paperjs.org/).

Why not make an animation as well? :)

{% include image.html url="/uploads/logo-animated.gif" width="400" caption="Logo Animated" alt="Logo Animated" %}{: .inline }

The project is open and located [here](https://github.com/Skillbill/company-logo)
