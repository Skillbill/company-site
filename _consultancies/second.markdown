As a recent graduate, I swiftly transitioned into the role of a software developer, gaining valuable experience in diverse projects covering both front-end and back-end development. My expertise lies primarily in back-end technologies, where I excel at building high-performance web services using Rust and Axum. On the front-end, I've demonstrated versatility, employing Elm, JavaScript/TypeScript with React/Solid/Vue, and Tailwind for various projects.

I embrace self-reflection as a crucial aspect of personal growth, consistently seeking to identify and overcome areas for improvement. By acknowledging and addressing my flaws, I strive to continuously enhance my skills and abilities.
