I started working in the embedded field, involving both hardware and software. I used low-level languages like VHDL and assembler, and then transitioned to C/C++. After that, I became a backend developer working primarily in Java and eventually also in Kotlin. Currently, my focus is on the web2/web3 scope, where I use React or Vue for development. Along the way, I have acquired extensive knowledge as a sys-op on the Linux platform, particularly in areas related to AWS and Kubernetes.

I enjoy my work, and I like delving into the implementation of libraries and frameworks to better understand their limitations. Moreover, I can adapt to any teammate I work with, even if I have my own preferences. I make an effort to extract the best from every person I interact with.
