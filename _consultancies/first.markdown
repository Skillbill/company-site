<b>20+ Experience in IT</b>

<b>Technical degree</b>

I started to work in the embedded both hardware and softare, using low level language like vhdl and assembler until C/C++.
Then I switched as backend developper in Java and ultimately also in kotlin.
Now I working specialy on the web2/web3 scope, using React or Vue.
I the meantime, I also acquire a lot of knowledge as sys-op on linux platform, specialy about AWS and kubernetes.

I like my work.
I like understand how the libraries/framework are implemented to better understand their limits.
Also if I have preferences, I able to adapt to every teammate I work with. I try to extract the good in every person.

I like humble people that are able to learn and don't think to know everything.
I like people that are able to understand if I'm wrong and explain why.
