<b>4 Experience in IT</b>

<b>Technical degree</b>

With expertise in people management and leadership, a keen eye for client requests, and strong estimation capabilities, I excel as a cross-technology enthusiast and problem solver. I have proven abilities to work under stressful conditions and in quality-oriented production environments. While specialising in front-end engineering, my computer engineering degree enables me to contribute valuable technical suggestions across the entire technology stack.

Empathic and Positive: I prioritise building strong connections by fostering empathy and maintaining a positive attitude. This allows me to effectively collaborate with colleagues and clients, creating a supportive work environment that leads to successful outcomes.

Accuracy: Meticulous attention to detail is a key strength of mine, enabling me to deliver precise and high-quality work consistently. By maintaining accuracy, I contribute to the overall success of projects and meet or exceed expectations.

Clear Communication: I excel in effectively conveying ideas and information, ensuring clear and transparent communication with all stakeholders. By being clear in my communications, I foster understanding, minimise misunderstandings, and facilitate efficient collaboration.

I appreciate working with trustworthy individuals at any level of seniority. Trustworthiness is essential in establishing strong working relationships and creating a positive team dynamic. Additionally, accuracy is highly valued, as it contributes to the overall quality of work and promotes a culture of excellence.
