The privacy of the users on the internet is of fundamental importance for skillbill.it.

#### What are cookies?

In order to function properly, this site may install small data files called Cookies on Users' PCs, as most large sites do. A cookie is a small text file that sites save on your computer or mobile device while you visit them. Cookies allow the site to remember your actions and preferences (e.g., login, language, font size, and other display settings) so that you don't have to re-enter them when you return to the site or navigate from one page to another. Cookies may remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are 'session cookies', which means they only exist when your web browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Other cookies are 'persistent cookies', which means that they survive after you close your browser and can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you then reopen your browser and browse the Internet again. Cookies can however be disabled individually or by adopting a general method for all.

### Technical cookies and profiling cookies:

1. Technical cookies make navigation possible and are not used for any other purpose. They are normally installed directly by the website. They are authentication and session cookies without which it would not be possible, or would be much more complex, to use the functionality of the website.

2. Profiling cookies are used to monitor and profile the user and their habits, their purpose is commercial, for example to direct advertising that responds to the user's interests, or provide third parties with information about their preferences.

- First-party profiling cookies: these are cookies sent to your browser directly from the site you are visiting.

- Third-party profiling cookies: these are cookies sent to your browser from other sites and not from the site you are visiting.

Log Files: Like many other websites this one also makes use of log files i.e. it records the history of operations as they are performed. The information contained within the log files includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider ([ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider)), date, time, entry and exit page and number of clicks. This is done to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement around the site, and gather demographic, IP address, and other information. This data cannot be traced in any way to the identity of the user.

The system of statistics used is [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/2919631?hl=en&ref_topic=1008008), which collects information on the origin of visits and other general details not attributable to a specific person but treated generically.

If you want to exclude your navigation from the collection of statistical data from Google Analytics you can download a [Google plugin](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to exclude yourself from the collection of data, for the browser used.
